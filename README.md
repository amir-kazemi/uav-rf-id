## One-shot Generative Data Augmentation with Bounded Divergence for UAV Identification in Limited RF Environments

### Dataset

This repository utilizes a preprocessed dataset derived from the original data available at [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f4c2b4n755/1). The preprocessing steps are implemented based on the code provided in the [DroneRF GitHub repository](https://github.com/Al-Sad/DroneRF).

#### Downloading the Dataset

To use the preprocessed dataset in your projects, please follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from Google Drive: [Download Preprocessed Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ge50DjRFIbrdZr77x2TVH-0Cx0sgUHzw/view?usp=drive_link).
2. Place the downloaded file into the `./data/` directory within your project structure.
